1. What is the definition of server port?
Ans: In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint. At the 
software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct 
that identifies a specific process or a type of network service. A port is 
identified for each transport protocol and address combination by a 16-bit 
unsigned number, know as the port number.

2. What is server port range?
Ans: Port numbers range from 0 to 65535, but only port numbers 0 to 1023
are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-know ports.

3. How many bits does number above represent?
Ans:The number of bits needed to represent a number in binary depends on the
number itself. If the number is large, more bits will be needed to write it 
in binary. A small number needs lesser bits. Consider the following examples:—

The number 0 can be represented with a single bit 0.

The number 1 can be represented with a single bit 1.

The number 2 can be represented with 2 bits: 10

Likewise, 9 needs 4 bits: 1001.

The number 38 is written as 100110 (6 bits).

Going further, the number 285 requires as many as 9 bits, as its binary 
representation is 100011101.

So, depending on the largeness of numbers you’re going to deal with, in 
whichever context you are going to apply binary notation, you will decide 
the number of bits you need.

Use this formula to find out the largest number that can be represented with 
n bits = 2n−1 

If you’re going to deal with smaller numbers, 4 bits should suffice (largest 
number: 15). For larger mathematical operations, 16 bits would be great 
(largest number: 65,535).
